I've been roaming around,
Always looking down and all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you
And all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers
Undercover of the street
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you
